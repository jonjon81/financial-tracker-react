Starting notes to incorporate for testing with Jest:

1) Conditional Rendering:
    - Test situations where conditional rendering occurs based on certain conditions.
    - make sure the component displays the correct content based on conditions (add and update modal).

2) Props Handling:
    - Test the component with different types or prop values

3) Component interaction: 
    - Test user interactions: clicks, input changes, and form submissions

4) Rendering: 
    - Check if the component renders without throwing any errors

5) State and Data:
    - Verify if state updates result in the expected data/ui changes
